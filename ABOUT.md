# Covid Map Trace

This is an application to compare users location history with the virus infected patient's route map. The user can report themselves through the app, if they find themselves to be in the vicinity of some patient at particular point of time in the past.
It also has an admin page for health workers/volunteers where they can login with their credentials to update patient route maps regularly.The app doesn't require personal details of patient or the user.

### Why 
We developed this with the goal in mind to trace the spread of virus without invading the privacy of regular users. We believe every individual is a responsible citizens and will take necessary actions to keep themselves and their loved once safe.

### How
The core algorithm of tracing runs on the client side browser, therefor the user location history never leaves the device. But the drawback being as the patient database get's bigger the tracing will take time. But we expect this application to be used during the early stages of a
virus spread, then it might not get to the point where the database is too large. Which means we can prevent a pandemic to occur in the first place!!!

#### Plus
It also has a map which shows hotspot areas. Compared to the hotspot areas in google map which just shows the containment zones, this one is more accurately made from patient route maps.
